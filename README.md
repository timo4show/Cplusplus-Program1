The most interesting thing to me are the methods and how you can call them while programming in c++. They are something new that I haven't learned in Python, or Python doesn't allow you to do something in that way. I need to work on some things like going back and compile out my code multiple times before I compile it once at the end. For me, that has been something that I need to work on. What I'm most excited about next is just practicing and learning more about c++ and ways I can write programs in fewer lines than I am doing them now. From this project, I have soaked up a lot, and I know that we have been shown a few different ways on how to write something that acts the same way. Lastly, the many roadblocks that I have come upon, I have done extensive research to figure them out and practice. Practicing for me I the best way I learn stuff, and doing it repetitively just helps even more with what I am trying to learn. This project, for me, has had a lot of information, and I know that we are over halfway done now!
